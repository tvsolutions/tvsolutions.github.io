## How this is setup
Just a few notes to my future self.

[Following the instructions here](http://davidensinger.com/2013/04/deploying-jekyll-to-github-pages/)

The gist of it is that you should ```git add``` and ```git commit``` as normal but then to push the command should be:

    git push --all origin
