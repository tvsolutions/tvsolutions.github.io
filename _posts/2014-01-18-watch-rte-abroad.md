1. [Sign up for a Smart DNS account at Overplay.net](http://www.overplay.net/#a_aid=tvsolutions). Overplay allows your computer to pretend that it's in Ireland. It will also pretend that it's in the UK if you want to watch the BBC iPlayer, 4OD, or the ITV Player.
2. Once your account is set up, visit the Smart DNS tab under [My Account](http://www.overplay.net/myaccount.php). There should be some text that reads...

	> SmartDNS is enabled for your IP address in _XXXXX_. Please use DNS servers _XX.XX.XXX.XXX_ and _XX.XXX.XXX.XXX_ to grant access to all compatible websites regardless of location.

	Make an note of both of the DNS server addresses, you'll need them shortly.
3. Visit this page for information on how to set Overplay Smart DNS up with your specific computer/device.
	- [Windows](http://overplay.net)
	- [OSX](http://overplay.net)
4. Once you've completed this step visit [http://rte.ie/player](http://rte.ie/player) to check if it's worked.
